## Overview of Make-It

- Make-It is an E-Commerce platform for selling and buying products with customization according to buyer affections. This platform is built using the MERN stack ( MongoDB, Express, React, Node js). With all the E-Commerce platform features, it also has unique features to customize the product to the buyer's needs. Sellers provide the required attachments for customizing, and customers upload desired product previews. After confirmation of the order, the Customer can also ask for changes in design and reject the designs provided by the seller. From the seller's perspective, the seller can confirm customer orders, make designs, Wait for approval, and get delivered after approval from both sides. It is designed in Figma.
